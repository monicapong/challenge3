# Module 3 Challenge

## JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator

This application was created to allow a user to generate a random string of characters to use as a strong, secured password. It emphasizes the use of JavaScript in order for the user to interact with prompts to include different criteria for their randomly generated password.


## Usage

If an invalid number is entered, an alert will pop up asking the user to enter a number between 8 and 128.

The window will then ask the user a set of criteria questions to include in their randomly generated password. Select "OK" for yes and "Cancel" for no.
